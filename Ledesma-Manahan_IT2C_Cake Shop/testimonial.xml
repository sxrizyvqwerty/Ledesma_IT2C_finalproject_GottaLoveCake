		<description5>"The presentation of the cake was stunning with intricate decorations and layers. However, the taste didn't quite live up to the appearance. The cake was a bit dry, and the flavors were somewhat bland. I would rate it a 10/10."</description5>
		<description6>"I tried the Succulent Wedding cake, and it was light and fluffy just like I prefer. The vanilla flavor was subtle and not overpowering, which was perfect for my taste. The texture was spot on, and the frosting was smooth and creamy. I would give it an 8/10."</description6>
